what happens inside tokio 

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    hello().await;
}

async fn hello() {
    println!("Hello, async world!");
}

is replaced with 

fn main() {
    tokio::runtime::Builder::new_multi_thread(). // uses a builder pattern
        .enable_all()
        .build() 
        .unwrap()
        .block_on(tokio_main());
}

// block_on : block the main thread until the async is excecuted 
//  .build()  say you have 8 CPU 8 thread
async fn tokio_main() {
    hello().await;
}


async fn hello() {
    println!("Hello, async world!");
}

what really happens in async ? 


// Future is a trait, which comes with async 

what actually happens in await ? 
// a state machine is implemented 
enum TokioMainState {
    Start,
    AwaitingHello,
    Done,
}
// pining is a concept that u dont lose the memory when async is executed
